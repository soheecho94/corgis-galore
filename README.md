# Corgis Galore

## Description

This is the API side of the app Corgis Galore. You'll need to have this running for the client side to work. The client repository can be found [here!](https://github.com/soheecho94/corgis-galore-client)

## Getting Started

Please make sure you have Ruby and Rails set up in your environment.

To get the API running, please run `rails s -p 3001`. If you just run `rails s` please make sure that the client side is running on a different port and not p 3000.
